# collatz_conjecture
My very first script I created for an assignment I had in college. 

This Python script implements the Collatz Conjecture (also known as the "3n + 1 problem"). The program takes a number as input, performs the Collatz operation iteratively, and prints the sequence until the number reaches 1.

## How It Works

The Collatz Conjecture states that:
- If a number is even, divide it by 2.
- If a number is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.

This process is repeated until the number becomes 1.

***EXAMPLE OUTPUT***

Good morning, enter a number: 6
6
3
10
5
16
8
4
2
1
Final number is: 1
